## Coursera "Getting and cleaning data" project Code Book

We use data set "Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set" downloaded from UCI Machine Learining Repository, https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . Data were downloaded and stored in data frames. Data consist of 10299 measurements separated into 7352 training and 2947 test ones. Each measurement (row) has 561 attributes as described in *features.txt* file. These data re stored in *x_train.txt* and *x_test.txt* files. Apart of these files, there are also files *y_train.txt* and *y_test.txt* containing information about the activity (described in *activity_labels.txt*) and *subj_train.txt* and *subj_test.txt* that contain information about the person (experiment was done on a population of 30 persons).
